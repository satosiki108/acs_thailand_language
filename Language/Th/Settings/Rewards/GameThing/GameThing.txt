89	Evil Deterring	An artifact made from a wooden sword and can deter evil.
125	Perfected Warrior Sword	Also known as the Exorcist Prime, the Perfected Warrior used this precious sword to expel all evils. About 3 inches long, the sword is reforged from jade stones with the true powers of exorcism; it thus has an imposing purplish glow around it. Once drawn, it transforms into inch-long violet lightening bolts that destroy everything they touch.
